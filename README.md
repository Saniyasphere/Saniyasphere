**TASK 4: DATA ANALYSIS**

This task involves performing data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in key metrics. The analysis covers various aspects such as user activity, resource usage, and event data. Outliers in different columns are identified and visualized through boxplots and scatter plots to understand data distribution and user behavior. Correlation analysis is also performed to uncover relationships between key metrics. Insights from the analysis will guide decision-making for optimizing performance and improving key metrics.
